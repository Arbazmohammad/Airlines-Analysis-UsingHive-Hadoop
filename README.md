# Airlines-Analysis-UsingHive-Hadoop
Hi, Welcome to my Git.

-> This Hadoop project involves Analysing the Airlines datasets and solving few problem statements.

-> There are multiple ways to approach this problem such as PIG, Map Reduce algorithms etc.

-> I'm using the HIVE approach. It's the most popular and widely used approach when it comes to analysing datasets within Hadoop.


Problem Statements:

A. Find list of Airports operating in the Country India

B. Find the list of Airlines having zero stops

C. List of Airlines operating with code share

D. Which country (or) territory having highest Airports

E. Find the list of Active Airlines in United state

In this use case, there are 3 data sets:

-> Final_airlines, routes.dat, airports_mod.dat
